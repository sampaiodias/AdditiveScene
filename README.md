# AdditiveScene

This project includes a script solution (AdditiveSceneManager and a few other scripts) to make loading scenes in Additive mode easier. This repository also includes the entire project used for tests (including Standard Assets). 

**If you only want the script solution, [download the latest package from the Releases folder](https://github.com/sampaiodias/AdditiveScene/tree/master/Releases).**
