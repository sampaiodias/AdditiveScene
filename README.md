# AdditiveScene

This repository includes:
* AdditiveSceneManager for handling load/unload during runtime
* AdditiveSceneCollider for loading/unloading certain Scenes when the player touches the collider (trigger)
* SceneSetup for saving and loading Scene configurations using ScriptableObjects
* The Unity project used for testing the features above (fairly big because of Standard Assets)

**If you only want the script solution, [download the latest package from the Releases folder](https://github.com/sampaiodias/AdditiveScene/tree/master/Releases).**
